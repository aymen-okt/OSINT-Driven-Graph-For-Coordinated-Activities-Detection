A New York jury found him guilty earlier this year in an illegal hush money scheme intended to cover up a sexual encounter with an adult film actress before the 2016 election. Trump has faced three other local or federal indictments this year, including for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. He was impeached twice as president, but acquitted by the Senate in both cases.\n\nAt 78, Trump will be the oldest person ever inaugurated as president  – a few months older than Biden was when he took office in 2021.\n\nWatch PBS News for daily, breaking and live news, plus special coverage.

At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it.

As votes continue to be counted, Trump will prepare to retake the White House.\n\nWisconsin was the state that pushed Trump over the 270 electoral vote threshold to secure a second, nonconsecutive term in the White House. He is the first president since Grover Cleveland became the 22nd and 24th president in 1885 and 1893.\n\nHe flipped Georgia back to Republicans, kept North Carolina red in the presidential race and shattered the \"blue wall,\" winning Pennsylvania in a final crushing blow to Harris' path to victory.\n\nTrump is also setting records for being the oldest president elected at 78 and is the first person who has been convicted of a felony to win the Oval Office. His rise back to the White House comes after a whirlwind four years that included criminal charges, two assassination attempts and an upheaval on the Democratic ticket opposing him.\n\nTrump’s electoral victory brings an end to a divisive and tumultuous presidential campaign that presented Americans with a stark contrast in choice between candidates that do not agree on essentially any of the major issues facing the country. A record 84 million Americans voted early in this year’s election that included new benchmarks being set in pivotal swing states like Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan.\n\nHe did not mention Harris during his speech early Wednesday morning, and Harris did not speak to supporters at all Tuesday night. Her campaign said she would address supporters until Wednesday.\n\nTrump centered his campaign around immigration and the economy, frequently tying Harris to unpopular President Joe Biden and his administration’s handling of both the issues. He has proposed enacting strict immigration laws, including deporting thousands of immigrants in the country without legal permission and overhauling the nation’s asylum laws, frequently highlighting crimes committed against Americans by people in the U.S. illegally.\n\nOn the economy, Trump has frequently harped on inflation that has pinched wallets and vowed to remake the economy and revitalize the nation’s manufacturing industry through tax cuts and expansive tariffs on foreign goods that economists say could have a detrimental impact on inflation.\n--------------------------------------------------\nFor more on the lead story: https://bit.ly/4fdpQLv\n_______________\nStay up to date with our social media:\n\nKOMO News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KOMONews/\nKOMO News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/komonews\nKOMO News on Instagram: http://instagram.com/komo4\nKOMO News on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@komo4seattle\n\nSubscribe to KOMO on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC__2_0RJ8XnHt2angfw6S1Q/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch more top local news stories: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G97AyNO_3IE&list=PLZm7uq7_dyY6qhFFIwgXRvYpkaOnZEabc&index=2&t=0s\n\nFor all of the day’s top local and national news, visit http://www.komonews.com/\nWatch our live newscasts and other live video at https://komonews.com/watch\n\nDownload our iOS App: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/komo-news-mobile/id433508161?mt=8 \n\nDownload our Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newssynergy.komo&hl=en \n\nHave a news tip?

At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics.

The show features a colorful cast of dogs in a vibrant world where they sing fun and educational songs that teach learning and cognitive fundamentals aimed at preschoolers, toddlers and kids of all ages around the world.\n\nThe songs help promote social emotional development as well as age related cognitive development in the preschool set as well as providing engaging content for older children. We cover a wide range of engaging topics such as letters, numbers, colors, animals, good habits, hygiene, accepting others and more, along with modern remixes of classic nursery rhymes. Our music is made by award winning producers and singers resulting in tunes that everyone in the family can enjoy, allowing parents to participate in their child’s learning experience.\n\nThe show is centered on a group of puppies led by an adult mentor named Bow Wizzle. Every dog is different in color and shape to help promote diversity and inclusion. Our mission statement as a black owned company is to make sure our videos embody inclusivity so that kids and parents from all walks of life, ethnicities and backgrounds feel welcomed and empowered.\n\n\nWEBSITE: https://doggyland.net/\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/doggyland_kids/\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@doggyland_kids\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/doggylandkids\nCOLLAB WITH GRACIE'S CORNER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe8ZGvhfNZI", "tags": ["doggyland", "nursery rhymes", "kids songs", "snoop dogg", "kids music", "sing alongs", "election day", "vote song", "election song for kids", "doggyland vote song", "vote songs for kids", "election for kids", "president", "toddler", "toddler song", "kindergarten", "kindergarten song", "children", "kids video", "sing-along", "Doggyland song", "doggyland video", "kids animation", "sing along", "kids sing along", "kids music video", "songs for kids", "music for kids", "pre-k", "preschool", "toddlers", "nursery rhyme", "song", "animated sing along"], "category_id": "27", "default_language": "en", "default_audio_language": "en", "view_count": "938851", "like_count": "601", "comment_count": null, "duration": "PT2M23S"}
